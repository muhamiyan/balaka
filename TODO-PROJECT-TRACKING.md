# TODO: Project Tracking (1.9)

## Purpose

Track profitability per project/job for service businesses. Simple tagging approach - not full project management.

## Dependencies

- COA (1.1) - accounts for revenue/expense tracking
- JournalEntryService (1.2) - creates journal entries
- Transactions (1.5) - link transactions to projects
- AccountBalanceCalculator (1.3) - profitability calculations
