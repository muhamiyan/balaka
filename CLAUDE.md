## Development Guidelines

1. **Feature completion criteria:** Item is only checked when verified by Playwright functional test
2. **No fallback/default values:** Throw errors instead of silently handling missing data
3. **Technical language:** No marketing speak, strictly technical documentation
4. **Test-driven:** Write functional tests for new features
5. **Migration strategy:** Modify existing migrations instead of creating new ones (pre-production)

## Running the App

```bash
# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Run specific functional test
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest

# Run with visible browser (debugging)
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=100
```

## Database

- PostgreSQL via Testcontainers (tests)
- Flyway migrations: V001-V004
- Seed data: IT Services COA, admin user (admin/admin)

## Architecture

```
User → Controller (MVC) → Service → Repository → PostgreSQL
         ↓
    Thymeleaf Templates (HTMX + Alpine.js)
```

## Current Focus

Phase 6 (Security Hardening) in progress!

Phase 5 highlights (complete):
- Product and ProductCategory entities with FIFO/Weighted Average costing
- Inventory transactions: Purchase, Sale, Adjustment, Production In/Out
- FIFO layers and weighted average cost calculation
- BOM (Bill of Materials) for simple production
- Production orders with component consumption and finished goods receipt
- Auto-COGS calculation on sales with margin analysis
- Product profitability reports
- Playwright functional tests (73+ tests)

Phase 6 highlights (in progress):
- Field-level encryption (AES-256-GCM) for PII fields
- Document storage encryption with backward compatibility
- Password complexity enforcement (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special)
- Account lockout (5 attempts, 30-minute lockout)
- Rate limiting on login and API endpoints
- Comprehensive security audit logging
- Data masking for sensitive fields in UI
- GDPR/UU PDP compliance (DSAR export, anonymization)
- DevSecOps: CodeQL, SonarCloud, OWASP Dependency-Check, ZAP DAST
- Security regression tests (Playwright + JUnit)

Next: Complete Phase 6 remaining items (consent management, container security)
