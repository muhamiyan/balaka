## Planned Features

No planned phases. Future enhancements are implemented on-demand when client needs arise. See `docs/06-implementation-plan.md` "Future Enhancements" section.

## Multi-Industry Expansion Strategy

### Architecture Vision

The accounting system serves as a generic core that industry-specific applications can integrate with:

```
Domain App (Grant Mgmt, POS, etc.)
        │
        │ POST /api/transactions
        ▼
Core Accounting API
├── COA Management
├── Journal Templates
├── Template Execution
└── Reports
```

### Integration Pattern: Store and Forward (SAF)

Domain apps call accounting API with:
1. Validate business rules locally
2. Call accounting API to create journal entries
3. Handle failures with retry/idempotency

```json
POST /api/transactions
{
    "idempotencyKey": "domain-app-expense-123",
    "templateCode": "EXPENSE-CASH",
    "transactionDate": "2024-12-03",
    "amount": 50000000,
    "variables": {
        "expenseAccount": "5.1.01",
        "cashAccount": "1.1.01"
    }
}
```

### Domain Apps That Can Integrate

| Domain | Features | Integration |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Grant Management | Fund tracking, compliance, budgets | API calls for journal entries |
| Inventory (Advanced) | COGS, warehouse management | Built-in module (Phase 5) |
| POS | Sales, receipts, daily settlement | API calls |
| Real Estate | Property, tenants, leases | API calls |
| Manufacturing | BOM, work orders, production costing | API calls |

### What Stays in Core

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| COA Management | UI + API |
| Journal Templates | UI + API |
| Template Execution | API primary |
| Basic Reports | UI + API |
| Payroll (Indonesian) | Built-in module |
| Tax Compliance (Indonesian) | Built-in module |
| Fixed Assets | Built-in module |
| Inventory (Simple) | Built-in module (Phase 5) |

### Why Inventory/Production is Built-in

Unlike fund accounting, inventory transactions fit the existing journal template model:

```
Purchase raw materials:
  Dr Raw Materials Inventory    Rp 500,000
  Cr Cash                       Rp 500,000

Sale with COGS:
  Dr Cash                       Rp 600,000
  Cr Sales Revenue              Rp 600,000

  Dr COGS                       Rp 400,000
  Cr Finished Goods             Rp 400,000
```

No new dimension needed on journal entries. Standard debit/credit flows.

### Why Fund Accounting Requires Separate App

Fund accounting requires tracking two dimensions per entry:
- Natural account (Equipment Expense)
- Fund (NSF Grant 2024-001)

Current model has single `account_id` per journal entry. Adding `fund_id` would:
- Pollute generic model
- Add complexity for non-fund users
- Require fund balance tracking
- Need restriction validation logic

Correct approach: Separate Grant Management app owns fund logic, calls Accounting API for journal recording.
