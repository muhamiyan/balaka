# Technology Stack

## Overview

This document outlines the technology stack selection for the accounting application, including alternatives considered and justification for final choices.

## Architecture Candidates Evaluated

### Option 1: Spring Boot + React/Vue (Split Backend/Frontend)

## Migration Path

If requirements change, the monolith can evolve:

### Phase 1: Current (Monolith)
```mermaid
graph LR
    Users --> SpringBoot["Spring Boot<br/>Monolith"]
    SpringBoot --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
```

### Phase 2: Extract API (If Mobile App Needed)
```mermaid
graph LR
    Web[Web Users] --> SpringBoot["Spring Boot<br/>Monolith"]
    Mobile[Mobile App] --> API["REST API Layer"]
    API --> Services["Shared Services"]
    SpringBoot --> Services
    Services --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
```

### Phase 3: Microservices (If Scale Requires)
```mermaid
graph LR
    Web[Web/Mobile] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth[Auth Service]
    Gateway --> Trans[Transaction Service]
    Gateway --> Tax[Tax Service]
    Gateway --> Report[Report Service]
    Trans --> DB1[(PostgreSQL)]
    Tax --> DB2[(PostgreSQL)]
    Report --> DB3[(PostgreSQL)]
```

**Key Point:** Start simple, refactor when needed. Premature optimization wastes effort.
