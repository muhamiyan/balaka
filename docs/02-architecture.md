# System Architecture

## Core Design Principle: Transaction-Centric

### Traditional Account-Centric Approach (What We're NOT Doing)

In traditional accounting software, users must understand debits/credits:

**Example: Paying electricity bill Rp 1,000,000**
```
User must know:
Debit:  Beban Listrik (Electricity Expense)     Rp 1,000,000
Credit: Kas/Bank (Cash/Bank)                    Rp 1,000,000
```

**Problems:**
- Requires understanding which accounts to debit/credit
- Must remember debit = expense increase, credit = cash decrease
- Easy to get backwards
- Intimidating for beginners

### Our Transaction-Centric Approach

Users describe business events; system handles accounting.

**Same example: Paying electricity bill**

User fills simple form:
```
Transaction Type: Expense Payment
Date: 2025-01-15
Description: Electricity bill
Category: Utilities - Electricity
Amount: Rp 1,000,000
Paid from: BCA Checking Account
```

System automatically generates proper journal entries:
```
Debit:  Beban Listrik        Rp 1,000,000
Credit: Bank BCA             Rp 1,000,000
```

### More Examples

**Receive customer payment:**
- Form: "Receive Payment"
- Fields: Customer name, Invoice #, Amount, Bank account
- User never sees "Debit Bank, Credit Piutang"

**Purchase inventory:**
- Form: "Purchase"
- Fields: Supplier, Items, Quantity, Price, Payment method
- System handles: Debit Inventory, Credit Bank (or Hutang if unpaid)

**Owner withdrawal:**
- Form: "Owner Withdrawal"
- Fields: Amount, Date, Bank account
- System: Debit Prive/Modal, Credit Bank

## Three-Layer Architecture

    B["Business Logic Layer<br/>(Journal Templates - Mapping Rules)"]
    C["Data Layer<br/>(Chart of Accounts + Journal Entries)"]

    A --> B --> C
```

### Layer 1: User Layer (Transaction Forms)

**Purpose:** Present business-friendly interfaces

**Characteristics:**
- Simple forms for common business scenarios
- No accounting jargon
- Validation and guidance
- Preview of what will be recorded

**Example Forms:**
- Terima Pembayaran dari Customer
- Bayar Supplier
- Bayar Gaji Karyawan
- Bayar Beban Operasional
- Catat Penjualan
- Tarik Tunai untuk Pribadi

### Layer 2: Business Logic Layer (Journal Templates)

**Purpose:** Translate business transactions into accounting entries

**Key Features:**
- Pre-configured templates for common scenarios
- User-customizable templates for power users
- Mapping rules: transaction fields → accounting accounts
- Amount calculation logic (percentages, formulas)
- Support for simple to complex entries

**Template Types:**

1. **System Templates** (preloaded, available to all tenants)
   - Common business transactions
   - Indonesian tax scenarios
   - Industry-specific templates

2. **Custom Templates** (created by power users)
   - Business-specific workflows
   - Complex multi-line entries
   - Exotic accounting scenarios

**Template Capabilities:**
- Fixed accounts (e.g., PPN Masukan always goes to account 1-1400)
- User-selectable accounts (e.g., which expense category)
- Calculated amounts (e.g., PPN = 11% of base amount)
- Multiple debit/credit lines (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)

### Layer 3: Data Layer (Chart of Accounts)

**Purpose:** Maintain proper double-entry bookkeeping

**Characteristics:**
- Standard chart of accounts structure
- Industry-specific templates
- Hierarchical account organization
- Full audit trail
- Immutable journal entries (soft delete only)

## Journal Template System

### How Templates Work

**Template Definition:**
```
Template: "Bayar Beban + PPN Masukan"

Lines:
1. Debit  | User selects account    | 100% of transaction amount  | Label: "Akun Beban"
2. Debit  | Fixed: PPN Masukan      | 11% of transaction amount   | Auto
3. Credit | User selects account    | 111% of transaction amount  | Label: "Dibayar dari"
```

**User Experience:**
```
Form displays:
- Jumlah (DPP): Rp 1,000,000
- Kategori Beban: [dropdown - user selects]
- Dibayar dari: [dropdown - user selects]

Preview shows:
Debit:  Beban Sewa Kantor    Rp 1,000,000
Debit:  PPN Masukan          Rp   110,000
Credit: Bank BCA             Rp 1,110,000
                             ============
Total:                       Rp         0  ✓ Balanced
```

**Posted Journal Entries:**
```
Date: 2025-01-15
Reference: TRX-00123

Account              Debit         Credit
5-2100 Beban Sewa    1,000,000     -
1-1400 PPN Masukan     110,000     -
1-1200 Bank BCA        -           1,110,000
                     ===========   ===========
                     1,110,000     1,110,000  ✓
```

### Template Examples

#### Simple Template: Cash Sale
```
Lines:
1. Debit  | User: "Bank Account"        | 100%
2. Credit | User: "Revenue Account"     | 100%
```

#### Medium Complexity: Expense with Tax
```
Lines:
1. Debit  | User: "Expense Account"     | 100%
2. Debit  | Fixed: "PPN Masukan"        | 11%
3. Credit | User: "Payment Account"     | 111%
```

#### Complex: Payment with Discount
```
Lines:
1. Debit  | Fixed: "Hutang Usaha"       | invoice_amount
2. Credit | User: "Bank Account"        | payment_amount
3. Credit | User: "Discount Account"    | discount_amount
```

#### Power User: Multi-Split Allocation
```
Lines:
1. Debit  | User: "Cabang A Expense"    | user_defined
2. Debit  | User: "Cabang B Expense"    | user_defined
3. Debit  | User: "Cabang C Expense"    | user_defined
4. Credit | User: "Payment Account"     | sum_of_debits
```

## Deployment Architecture: Single-Tenant Instances

### Design Philosophy

**Instance-per-Client Approach:**
- Each company gets its own application instance
- Each instance connects to its own database
- Complete isolation at process and data level
- No multi-tenancy code complexity

### Why Single-Tenant?

**Codebase Simplicity:**
- No `tenant_id` in every query
- No tenant context management
- No risk of cross-tenant data leaks
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

**Security Benefits:**
- Complete process isolation
- Separate databases per company
- No shared resources
- Easier compliance for accounting data

**Operational Flexibility:**
- Can co-locate multiple instances on shared VPS (cost-effective)
- Can isolate high-value clients on dedicated VPS (premium)
- Independent updates per client
- Restart/debug single client without affecting others

### Deployment Options

**Option 1: Co-located Instances (Cost-Optimized)**
```
Shared VPS ($12-24/mo)
├── PostgreSQL Service
│   ├── database: company_a
│   ├── database: company_b
│   └── database: company_c
├── MinIO (shared object storage with separate buckets)
├── Spring Boot Instance 1 (Company A) - Port 8081
├── Spring Boot Instance 2 (Company B) - Port 8082
└── Spring Boot Instance 3 (Company C) - Port 8083
```

**Option 2: Dedicated Instance (Premium)**
```
Dedicated VPS ($24+/mo)
├── PostgreSQL (single database)
├── MinIO (dedicated storage)
└── Spring Boot Instance (single client)
```

### No Multi-Tenancy Tables

**Simple database schema without tenant_id:**
```sql
-- No tenant_id needed
transactions
- id                    UUID PRIMARY KEY
- transaction_date      DATE NOT NULL
- description           TEXT NOT NULL
- total_amount          DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL

chart_of_accounts
- id                    UUID PRIMARY KEY
- code                  VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
- name                  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
- account_type          VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL

-- Clean queries, no tenant filtering
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE transaction_date >= '2025-01-01';
```

### User Roles (Per Instance)

**Note:** Each instance is single-company, so roles are simpler:

1. **Owner** (business owner)
   - Full administrative access
   - User management
   - Subscription/billing access

2. **Bookkeeper** (day-to-day operations)
   - Create/edit transactions
   - Generate reports
   - Cannot modify chart of accounts
   - Cannot delete posted transactions

3. **Accountant** (senior staff)
   - All bookkeeper capabilities
   - Modify chart of accounts
   - Create custom journal templates
   - Manual journal entries
   - Period closing

4. **Viewer** (read-only)
   - View all reports
   - Export data
   - No data entry

5. **Auditor** (temporary access)
   - Read-only access to all data
   - View complete audit trail
   - Download documents
   - Time-bound access
   - No modifications allowed

## Data Flow

### Transaction Entry → Journal Posting

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[1. User selects template] --> B[2. System loads template definition]
    B --> C[3. Form renders with required fields]
    C --> D[4. User fills form]
    D --> E[5. System validates input]
    E --> F[6. System generates preview<br/>journal entry lines]
    F --> G[7. System validates balance<br/>debit = credit]
    G --> H[8. User confirms]
    H --> I[9. Transaction saved<br/>status: draft]
    I --> J[10. Journal entries created<br/>linked to transaction]
    J --> K[11. Transaction status → posted]
    K --> L[12. General ledger balances updated]
```

### Template Resolution Logic

```python
def generate_journal_entries(transaction, template):
    entries = []

    for line in template.lines:
        entry = {}

        # Resolve account
        if line.account_id:
            # Fixed account in template
            entry.account = line.account_id
        else:
            # User-selected account from transaction
            entry.account = transaction.mappings[line.mapping_key]

        # Calculate amount
        if line.amount_source == 'transaction_amount':
            entry.amount = transaction.amount * line.amount_value / 100
        elif line.amount_source == 'fixed':
            entry.amount = line.amount_value
        elif line.amount_source == 'formula':
            entry.amount = eval_formula(line.formula, transaction)

        # Set debit/credit
        entry.debit = entry.amount if line.line_type == 'debit' else 0
        entry.credit = entry.amount if line.line_type == 'credit' else 0

        entries.append(entry)

    # Validate balance
    assert sum(e.debit for e in entries) == sum(e.credit for e in entries)

    return entries
```

## Current Phase: Manual Deployment

### Initial Setup (Own Company)
1. Provision VPS manually (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run docker-compose up
5. Access application via domain/IP

### Adding New Clients (Early Customers)
1. Create new database on existing PostgreSQL
2. Add new service to docker-compose.yml
3. Configure subdomain and Nginx
4. Deploy with docker-compose up -d

### Focus: Product Validation
- Get the core accounting features rock solid
- Validate with real users (own company + early customers)
- Iterate on UX and functionality
- No infrastructure automation yet

## Future Phase: SaaS Automation

**Note:** This phase begins after core product is stable and proven.

### Control Plane Application

**Purpose:** Automate client provisioning and management

**Features:**
- Client onboarding wizard
- Subscription and billing management
- Automated VPS provisioning (via Pulumi)
- Deployment orchestration
- Monitoring dashboard
- Support ticketing

### Infrastructure as Code: Pulumi

**Why Pulumi over Ansible:**
- Programmatic VPS creation (DigitalOcean, AWS API)
- Real programming language (TypeScript, Python, Java)
- Type-safe infrastructure code
- Built-in state management
- Can be called from Java admin app via Automation API
- Better for creating resources (Ansible better for configuring existing)

**Provisioning Flow:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Control Plane App
    participant Pulumi as Pulumi
    participant Cloud as Cloud Provider
    participant VPS as New VPS

    Admin->>Pulumi: Trigger stack creation
    Pulumi->>Cloud: Create VPS + DNS
    Cloud->>VPS: Provision server
    Cloud-->>Pulumi: Return IP
    Pulumi->>VPS: Install Docker
    Pulumi->>VPS: Deploy app containers
    Pulumi->>VPS: Setup Nginx + SSL
    Pulumi-->>Admin: Return outputs
    Admin->>Admin: Save client metadata
```

**Pulumi Stack Example:**
```typescript
// Programmatic VPS creation
const droplet = new digitalocean.Droplet(`client-${slug}`, {
    image: "ubuntu-22-04-x64",
    region: "sgp1",
    size: "s-1vcpu-2gb",  // $12/mo
});

// Configure DNS
const dns = new digitalocean.DnsRecord(`${slug}-dns`, {
    domain: "akuntingapp.com",
    type: "A",
    name: slug,
    value: droplet.ipv4Address,
});

// Deploy via SSH
const deploy = new command.remote.Command("deploy", {
    connection: { host: droplet.ipv4Address },
    create: `docker-compose up -d`,
});
```

**Control Plane Database:**
```sql
-- Metadata for all clients
clients
- id, company_name, slug, status
- vps_id, database_name, subdomain
- created_at, trial_end_date

vps_servers
- id, provider, ip_address, spec
- max_clients, monthly_cost

subscriptions
- id, client_id, plan_id, status
- billing_cycle, amount

deployments
- id, client_id, version, status
- pulumi_stack_name, started_at
```

### Scaling Strategy

**Phase 1 (1-10 clients):**
- Manual provisioning
- Co-located on single VPS
- Learn what customers need

**Phase 2 (10-50 clients):**
- Build control plane app
- Automate with Pulumi
- Multiple shared VPS

**Phase 3 (50+ clients):**
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Dedicated VPS for premium tier
- Geographic distribution (Singapore, Jakarta)

## Current Scalability Considerations

### Performance (Per Instance)
- Database indexing for common queries
- Materialized views for complex reports
- Async report generation for heavy workloads
- Connection pooling optimization

### Storage
- Soft deletes for audit trail
- Archival strategy for old fiscal years
- MinIO for document storage
- Periodic backup to cloud storage

### Monitoring (Per Instance)
- Spring Boot Actuator metrics
- Application logs

- Disk space alerts

## Security Principles

### Data Protection
- Instance-level isolation (no shared data)
- Audit log for all modifications
- Immutable journal entries (append-only)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Encrypted database credentials

### Compliance
- Complete audit trail for tax purposes
- 10-year data retention policy
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Export capabilities for audits
- Indonesian data residency compliance
