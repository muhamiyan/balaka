  - Created DataMaskingUtil.java with maskNik, maskNpwp, maskPhone, maskBankAccount, maskBpjs, maskEmail
  - Created ThymeleafConfig.java with custom #mask dialect for templates
  - Applied masking in employees/detail.html and users/detail.html
- [x] ~~Add @SecureField annotation for role-based field visibility~~ - Won't implement: Thymeleaf sec:authorize already provides role-based field visibility in templates
- [x] ~~Mask sensitive fields in API responses~~ - Won't implement: No REST API - MVC app uses Thymeleaf templates with sec:authorize and #mask dialect

  - [x] Retention status check - DataSubjectService.getRetentionStatus() (10-year retention per UU KUP Art. 28)
  - N/A ~~Automated purge job~~ — 10-year tax retention means no data expires in foreseeable future
  - N/A ~~Pre-deletion notification~~
- N/A ~~Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)~~ — minimal PII scope, not a high-volume data processor

---

## Phase 7: API Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Expose REST API for external integrations, mobile apps, and domain-specific applications

**Note:** Most API infrastructure was built organically during Phases 6/9/Analysis. This phase tracks what was already done and the remaining items.

### 7.1 API Core ✅

**Authentication (OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization, RFC 8628):**
- [x] DeviceCode entity (user_code, device_code, 15-min expiry, status workflow)
- [x] DeviceToken entity (hashed token, scopes, 30-day expiry, revocation support)
- [x] DeviceAuthService (generate codes, validate tokens, revoke)
- [x] BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter (Bearer token validation, scope extraction)
- [x] DeviceAuthApiController (`POST /api/device/code`, `POST /api/device/token`)
- [x] DeviceAuthorizationController (browser-based user authorization page)

**API Controllers:**
- [x] DraftTransactionApiController (`/api/drafts`) — from-receipt, from-text, approve, reject
- [x] TransactionApiController (`/api/transactions`) — create, post, bulk-post
- [x] TemplateApiController (`/api/templates`) — CRUD
- [x] FinancialAnalysisApiController (`/api/analysis`) — reports, snapshots, trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary, receivables, payables, accounts, drafts, transactions (paginated)
- [x] BankReconciliationApiController (`/api/bank-reconciliation`) — full recon workflow
- [x] DataImportApiController (`/api/data-import`) — bulk ZIP import

**Infrastructure:**
- [x] ApiExceptionHandler — structured JSON error responses (error code, message, timestamp, fieldErrors)
- [x] SecurityAuditService — API call audit logging (async)
- [x] 7 OAuth scopes: `drafts:create`, `drafts:approve`, `drafts:read`, `analysis:read`, `analysis:write`, `transactions:post`, `data:import`
- [x] `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_...')")` on all API endpoints
- [x] Static API capabilities descriptor (`/api/capabilities.json`)
- N/A ~~Idempotency key on Transaction~~ — low ROI, extensive schema/logic changes for unlikely duplicate scenario
- N/A ~~Separate ApiKey entity~~ — DeviceToken already serves this purpose with scopes and revocation
- N/A ~~Separate AccountApiController~~ — accounts exposed via `/api/analysis/accounts` and `/api/drafts/accounts`
- N/A ~~Separate ReportApiController~~ — reports exposed via `/api/analysis/*` (trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary)
- N/A ~~OpenAPI/Swagger~~ — `/api/capabilities.json` provides machine-readable API discovery for AI consumers
- N/A ~~Per-key rate limiting~~ — global `RateLimitFilter` already covers all endpoints; per-key throttling unnecessary for single-company app
- N/A ~~API versioning~~ — premature for single-deployment app; can add later if needed

### 7.2 API Pagination ✅
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/transactions` — paginated (page, size params, returns Page<T>)
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/reports` — paginated (page, size params, default 0/20)

- [x] Revoke all tokens for current user
- [x] Token usage info (last_used_at, last_used_ip)
- [x] Sidebar link (Perangkat API) in Master Data group
- [x] 5 Playwright functional tests

**Phase 7 Deliverable:** REST API with OAuth 2.0 device auth, 7 API controllers, structured error handling, and device token management UI.

  - [x] Fuzzy match (±1 day, same amount)
  - [x] Description keyword matching
- [x] Manual matching UI (drag-and-drop or checkbox)
- [x] Create missing transactions from unmatched statement items
- [x] Mark as "bank only" or "book only" for discrepancies

### 8.3 Reconciliation Reports
- [x] Reconciliation summary (matched, unmatched, discrepancies)
- [x] Bank reconciliation statement (book balance → bank balance)
- [x] Outstanding items list
- [x] PDF/Excel export

**Value analysis (manual reconciliation time per month):**

- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)
- 500+ transactions: 3+ hours (automation essential)

**Phase 8 Deliverable:** Bank statement import, auto-matching, manual matching UI, and reconciliation reports.

---

## Phase 12: Tax Data Management

**Goal:** Complete the tax data entry pipeline so all tax-related data (faktur pajak, bukti potong, client NPWP, fiscal periods) can be managed from within the app, eliminating reliance on external PDFs and Coretax as data sources.

**Context:** Phase 2 built the tax reporting and export infrastructure (TaxTransactionDetail entity, CoretaxExportService, tax calendar, tax reports). However, the data *input* path was never built — there is no UI or API to populate `tax_transaction_details`, no client management UI, and no fiscal period management UI. For FY2025, all tax data had to be cross-referenced manually from Coretax PDFs.

### Revenue Tax Workflow — FP Code 04 (Regular Client)

Applies to: Client-A, Client-B, BCA, Client-C, and other non-BUMN clients.

ArtiVisi collects PPN from client and remits it to state. Client withholds PPh 23.

**Example: Harga Jual 100,000,000**
- DPP = 100,000,000 × 11/12 = 91,666,667
- PPN = DPP × 12% = 11,000,000
- PPh 23 = 2% × DPP = 1,833,333
- Client pays = 100,000,000 + 11,000,000 - 1,833,333 = 109,166,667

**Step 1: Issue proforma invoice** (outside app)
- Send proforma/tagihan to client after work delivery
- No accounting entry in app

**Step 2: Client pays** (days to months later)
- Bank receives 109,166,667

**Step 3: Record in app** (on payment date)
- Post transaction using "Pendapatan Jasa + PPN + PPh 23" template:
  - DR Bank 109,166,667
  - DR Kredit Pajak PPh 23 1,833,333
  - CR Pendapatan 100,000,000
  - CR Hutang PPN 11,000,000
- Phase 12.4 auto-creates TaxTransactionDetail (taxType, DPP, PPN)

**Step 4: Issue Faktur Pajak in Coretax** (same day or next day)
- Create FP in Coretax → get FP number
- Issue real invoice + FP to client

**Step 5: Attach tax documents via API** (Claude Code)
- Parse FP PDF → post structured data to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/tax-details`
- Upload FP PDF to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/documents`
- Bupot arrives later (weeks/months) → update tax detail with bupot number + upload bupot PDF

**Step 6: Monthly PPN payment** (by 15th of next month)
- Post "Setor PPN" transaction: DR Hutang PPN / CR Bank
- Export e-Faktur Excel from app → file SPT Masa PPN in Coretax
- Mark tax calendar as completed

**Step 7: Annual**
- Accumulated Kredit Pajak PPh 23 → offset against PPh Badan in SPT Tahunan

### Revenue Tax Workflow — FP Code 03 (BUMN Client)

Applies to: BNI, Client-E, and other BUMN/government entities.

Key difference: **BUMN is pemungut PPN** — they withhold PPN and remit it directly to the state. ArtiVisi does NOT receive or pay PPN for these invoices. Client also withholds PPh 23.

**Example: Harga Jual 100,000,000**
- DPP = 100,000,000 × 11/12 = 91,666,667
- PPN = DPP × 12% = 11,000,000 (withheld by BUMN, not paid to ArtiVisi)
- PPh 23 = 2% × DPP = 1,833,333
- Client pays = 100,000,000 - 1,833,333 = 98,166,667 (no PPN in payment)

**Step 1-2: Same** (proforma invoice outside app, wait for payment)

**Step 3: Record in app** (on payment date)
- Post transaction using "Pendapatan Jasa BUMN (FP 03)" template:
  - DR Bank 98,166,667
  - DR Kredit Pajak PPh 23 1,833,333
  - CR Pendapatan 100,000,000
- No Hutang PPN entry — BUMN handles PPN remittance

**Step 4-5: Same** (issue FP in Coretax, Claude Code attaches FP/bupot data + PDFs)

**Step 6: Monthly PPN filing** (by 20th of next month)
- FP 03 invoices reported in SPT Masa PPN as "dipungut pemungut" (not payable by ArtiVisi)
- No PPN payment needed for these invoices

**Step 7: Same** (annual kredit pajak PPh 23 offset)

### 12.1 Fix PPN Template Formula ✅
- [x] Current formula `amount × 11/111` is incorrect for 2025 PPN (DPP Nilai Lain regime)

### 12.9 Retrofit 2025 Data

After Phase 12 features are deployed, clean up and repost all 2025 transactions with correct PPN formula and complete tax details. Direct database deletion (not void) to avoid audit trail clutter.

**Pre-requisites:**
- Phase 12.1 (PPN formula fix) deployed
- Phase 12.3 (tax detail API + document API) deployed
- Phase 12.5 (client management) deployed
- Full production database backup

**Step 1: Populate client master data**
- [ ] Create clients from FP counterparty data via UI or API: Client-A (0402405385016000), BNI (0010016061093000), Client-B (0840399323012000), Client-E (0010611903051000), Client-C (0406194035043000), BCA (0013084496091000), Client-F
- [ ] Include NPWP, NITKU, addresses extracted from FP PDFs

**Step 2: Clean up existing transactions**
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Delete all voided transactions (existing miscategorized voids — cleanup)
- [ ] Delete 22 revenue transactions posted with wrong PPN formula (`11/111`)
- [ ] Delete cascades to: journal_entries, journal_entry_lines, tax_transaction_details, transaction_documents
- [ ] Verify account balances are zeroed out for affected accounts

**Step 3: Repost with correct data** (Claude Code batch via API)
- [ ] Repost all 2025 revenue transactions using corrected PPN templates
- [ ] FP 04 invoices: use "Pendapatan Jasa + PPN + PPh 23" template (DR Bank, DR Kredit PPh 23, CR Pendapatan, CR Hutang PPN)
- [ ] FP 03 invoices (BUMN): use "Pendapatan Jasa BUMN" template (DR Bank, DR Kredit PPh 23, CR Pendapatan — no Hutang PPN)
- [ ] Repost all non-revenue transactions (expenses, tax payments, transfers, etc.) — these are unaffected by PPN formula but reposted for clean journal numbering

**Step 4: Attach tax details** (Claude Code batch via API)
- [ ] Parse 18 FP PDFs from `faktur-pajak/` folder
- [ ] Match each FP to the corresponding new transaction (by amount, date, client)
- [ ] Post structured FP data to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/tax-details`
- [ ] Upload FP PDFs to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/documents`
- [ ] Parse and attach bupot PDFs (once collected from clients)

**Step 5: Verify**
- [ ] Balance sheet matches expected balances
- [ ] Income statement totals unchanged (revenue same, PPN split corrected)
- [ ] Hutang PPN ledger matches sum of FP PPN amounts
- [ ] Kredit Pajak PPh 23 ledger matches sum of bupot amounts
- [ ] Coretax e-Faktur export produces correct data
- [ ] Tax summary report reconciles

**Phase 12 Deliverable:** Complete tax data management — entry UI/API for tax transaction details, client management, fiscal periods, corrected PPN formula, auto-population from templates, enhanced tax reports including rekonsiliasi fiskal, and retrofitted 2025 data.

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security (users, audit_logs, admin seed)
- V002: Core schema (COA, templates, transactions, clients, projects, invoices, vendors, bills, employees, payroll, assets, inventory, documents, tax)
- V003: Feature schema (device auth, bank recon, analysis reports, tags, alerts, payments, recurring transactions)
- V004: Seed data (transaction sequences, bank parser configs, alert rules)
- V900-V912: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
