| Aspect | Additive | Role Switching |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Security config | Standard Spring Security | Custom service |
| Session state | None | Track active role |
| UI components | None extra | Role switcher dropdown |
| After switch | N/A | Refresh/redirect needed |
| Lines of code | ~50 | ~150-200 |

---

## Phase 4: Analytics & Reconciliation

**Goal:** Transaction tagging, analytics, and bank reconciliation

- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)
- 500+ transactions: 3+ hours (automation essential)

**For typical small IT services (30-80 tx/month):** Manual reconciliation takes ~15 min/month.
Bank reconciliation feature becomes valuable at ~150+ transactions/month or with multiple bank accounts.

**Phase 4 Deliverable:** Transaction tagging, trend analysis, smart alerts, and bank reconciliation.

---

## Phase 5: Assets & Budget

**Goal:** Fixed asset tracking and budget management

**Implementation note:** Follow payroll pattern for journal posting:

- Use extended FormulaContext with domain-specific variables (e.g., `assetCost`, `accumulatedDepreciation`, `disposalProceeds`, `gainLoss`)
- Create system templates for: asset purchase, depreciation entry, asset disposal
- Keep asset-specific logic in AssetService, core accounting remains generic

- [ ] Settlement upload and parsing
- [ ] Order matching
- [ ] Fee expense auto-creation
- [ ] Marketplace reconciliation report

### Account Balances (Materialized) - Performance Optimization
- [ ] Account balances entity
- [ ] Balance update on journal entry post/void
- [ ] Period-based aggregation (monthly snapshots)
- [ ] Balance recalculation utility

**When to implement:** Only when report generation exceeds 2 seconds or users report slowness.

**Performance analysis (PostgreSQL with indexes):**
- 10,000 journal lines: <50ms (5 years @ 80 tx/month)
- 50,000 journal lines: ~100ms (5 years @ 400 tx/month)
- 100,000 journal lines: ~200ms (5 years @ 800 tx/month)
- 500,000 journal lines: ~500ms (5 years @ 4,000 tx/month)

**For typical small IT services (100 tx/month):** Would take 40+ years to reach 100,000 lines.
Materialization only needed at ~500+ transactions/month sustained for several years.

### Document Management Enhancements

- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
