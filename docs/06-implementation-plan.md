  - Created ThymeleafConfig.java with custom #mask dialect for templates
  - Applied masking in employees/detail.html and users/detail.html
- [x] ~~Add @SecureField annotation for role-based field visibility~~ - Won't implement: Thymeleaf sec:authorize already provides role-based field visibility in templates

---

## Phase 7: API Foundation ✅

**Goal:** Expose REST API for external integrations, mobile apps, and domain-specific applications

**Note:** Most API infrastructure was built organically during Phases 6/9/Analysis. This phase tracks what was already done and the remaining items.

### 7.1 API Core ✅

**Authentication (OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization, RFC 8628):**
- [x] DeviceCode entity (user_code, device_code, 15-min expiry, status workflow)
- [x] DeviceToken entity (hashed token, scopes, 30-day expiry, revocation support)
- [x] DeviceAuthService (generate codes, validate tokens, revoke)
- [x] BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter (Bearer token validation, scope extraction)
- [x] DeviceAuthApiController (`POST /api/device/code`, `POST /api/device/token`)
- [x] DeviceAuthorizationController (browser-based user authorization page)

**API Controllers:**
- [x] DraftTransactionApiController (`/api/drafts`) — from-receipt, from-text, approve, reject
- [x] TransactionApiController (`/api/transactions`) — create, post, bulk-post
- [x] TemplateApiController (`/api/templates`) — CRUD
- [x] FinancialAnalysisApiController (`/api/analysis`) — reports, snapshots, trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary, receivables, payables, accounts, drafts, transactions (paginated)
- [x] BankReconciliationApiController (`/api/bank-reconciliation`) — full recon workflow
- [x] DataImportApiController (`/api/data-import`) — bulk ZIP import

**Infrastructure:**
- [x] ApiExceptionHandler — structured JSON error responses (error code, message, timestamp, fieldErrors)
- [x] SecurityAuditService — API call audit logging (async)
- [x] 7 OAuth scopes: `drafts:create`, `drafts:approve`, `drafts:read`, `analysis:read`, `analysis:write`, `transactions:post`, `data:import`
- [x] `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_...')")` on all API endpoints
- [x] Static API capabilities descriptor (`/api/capabilities.json`)
- N/A ~~Idempotency key on Transaction~~ — low ROI, extensive schema/logic changes for unlikely duplicate scenario
- N/A ~~Separate ApiKey entity~~ — DeviceToken already serves this purpose with scopes and revocation
- N/A ~~Separate AccountApiController~~ — accounts exposed via `/api/analysis/accounts` and `/api/drafts/accounts`
- N/A ~~Separate ReportApiController~~ — reports exposed via `/api/analysis/*` (trial-balance, balance-sheet, income-statement, cash-flow, tax-summary)
- N/A ~~OpenAPI/Swagger~~ — `/api/capabilities.json` provides machine-readable API discovery for AI consumers
- N/A ~~Per-key rate limiting~~ — global `RateLimitFilter` already covers all endpoints; per-key throttling unnecessary for single-company app
- N/A ~~API versioning~~ — premature for single-deployment app; can add later if needed

### 7.2 API Pagination ✅
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/transactions` — paginated (page, size params, returns Page<T>)
- [x] `GET /api/analysis/reports` — paginated (page, size params, default 0/20)

- N/A ~~Cash flow trend (12 months)~~ — covered by AI analysis via `/api/analysis/cash-flow`
- N/A ~~Comparison: current period vs previous period~~ — AI snapshot already includes `*Change` fields
- N/A ~~Comparison: current period vs same period last year~~ — AI can compute from existing endpoints
- N/A ~~Chart library integration (Chart.js or similar)~~ — static charts low ROI vs AI-generated contextual analysis

## Phase 12: Tax Data Management ✅

**Goal:** Complete the tax data entry pipeline so all tax-related data (faktur pajak, bukti potong, client NPWP, fiscal periods) can be managed from within the app, eliminating reliance on external PDFs and Coretax as data sources.

**Context:** Phase 2 built the tax reporting and export infrastructure (TaxTransactionDetail entity, CoretaxExportService, tax calendar, tax reports). However, the data *input* path was never built — there is no UI or API to populate `tax_transaction_details`, no client management UI, and no fiscal period management UI. For FY2025, all tax data had to be cross-referenced manually from Coretax PDFs.

### Revenue Tax Workflow — FP Code 04 (Regular Client)

Applies to non-BUMN clients.

ArtiVisi collects PPN from client and remits it to state. Client withholds PPh 23.

**Example: Harga Jual 100,000,000**
- DPP = 100,000,000 × 11/12 = 91,666,667
- PPN = DPP × 12% = 11,000,000
- PPh 23 = 2% × DPP = 1,833,333
- Client pays = 100,000,000 + 11,000,000 - 1,833,333 = 109,166,667

**Step 1: Issue proforma invoice** (outside app)
- Send proforma/tagihan to client after work delivery
- No accounting entry in app

**Step 2: Client pays** (days to months later)
- Bank receives 109,166,667

**Step 3: Record in app** (on payment date)
- Post transaction using "Pendapatan Jasa + PPN + PPh 23" template:
  - DR Bank 109,166,667
  - DR Kredit Pajak PPh 23 1,833,333
  - CR Pendapatan 100,000,000
  - CR Hutang PPN 11,000,000
- Phase 12.4 auto-creates TaxTransactionDetail (taxType, DPP, PPN)

**Step 4: Issue Faktur Pajak in Coretax** (same day or next day)
- Create FP in Coretax → get FP number
- Issue real invoice + FP to client

**Step 5: Attach tax documents via API** (Claude Code)
- Parse FP PDF → post structured data to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/tax-details`
- Upload FP PDF to `POST /api/transactions/{id}/documents`
- Bupot arrives later (weeks/months) → update tax detail with bupot number + upload bupot PDF

**Step 6: Monthly PPN payment** (by 15th of next month)
- Post "Setor PPN" transaction: DR Hutang PPN / CR Bank
- Export e-Faktur Excel from app → file SPT Masa PPN in Coretax
- Mark tax calendar as completed

**Step 7: Annual**
- Accumulated Kredit Pajak PPh 23 → offset against PPh Badan in SPT Tahunan

### Revenue Tax Workflow — FP Code 03 (BUMN Client)

Applies to BUMN/government entities.

Key difference: **BUMN is pemungut PPN** — they withhold PPN and remit it directly to the state. ArtiVisi does NOT receive or pay PPN for these invoices. Client also withholds PPh 23.

**Example: Harga Jual 100,000,000**
- DPP = 100,000,000 × 11/12 = 91,666,667
- PPN = DPP × 12% = 11,000,000 (withheld by BUMN, not paid to ArtiVisi)
- PPh 23 = 2% × DPP = 1,833,333
- Client pays = 100,000,000 - 1,833,333 = 98,166,667 (no PPN in payment)

**Step 1-2: Same** (proforma invoice outside app, wait for payment)

**Step 3: Record in app** (on payment date)
- Post transaction using "Pendapatan Jasa BUMN (FP 03)" template:
  - DR Bank 98,166,667
  - DR Kredit Pajak PPh 23 1,833,333
  - CR Pendapatan 100,000,000
- No Hutang PPN entry — BUMN handles PPN remittance

**Step 4-5: Same** (issue FP in Coretax, Claude Code attaches FP/bupot data + PDFs)

**Step 6: Monthly PPN filing** (by 20th of next month)
- FP 03 invoices reported in SPT Masa PPN as "dipungut pemungut" (not payable by ArtiVisi)
- No PPN payment needed for these invoices

**Step 7: Same** (annual kredit pajak PPh 23 offset)

---

## Phase 14: Fiscal Adjustments API ✅

**Goal:** REST API for managing fiscal adjustment entries (koreksi fiskal). Entity, repository, service, and read-side API already exist. Only write-side API controller was missing.

**Context:** `FiscalAdjustment` entity, `FiscalAdjustmentRepository`, `TaxReportDetailService.saveAdjustment()` / `deleteAdjustment()` / `findAdjustmentsByYear()` all exist. `GET /api/tax-export/rekonsiliasi-fiskal` already reads from this table. MVC form handlers exist in `ReportController`. 2025 data was entered via direct SQL INSERT.

- [x] Functional test (4 tests: CRUD lifecycle, validation 400, not-found 404, empty list)

---

## Phase 15: Payroll API + PPh 21 ✅

**Goal:** REST API for payroll management with PPh 21 calculation and 1721-A1 generation. DB schema, entities, services, and MVC controllers already existed. REST API controllers added.

**Note:** TER rate lookup tables (PMK 168/2023) not yet implemented — existing annualization method used. Post-to-journal (`POST /api/payroll/{id}/post`) has a pre-existing issue: hardcoded template UUID `e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000014` doesn't match dynamically imported seed data UUIDs.

### 15.1 Salary Components API

- [x] `POST /api/payroll/{id}/approve` — set APPROVED
- [x] `POST /api/payroll/{id}/post` — post to accounting, set POSTED (blocked by template UUID issue)
- [x] `DELETE /api/payroll/{id}` — only if DRAFT

### 15.4 PPh 21 Calculation Engine
- [x] Annual reconciliation: bruto → biaya jabatan → neto → PTKP → PKP → progressive tax (existing Pph21CalculationService)
- [x] PTKP amounts (PMK 101/2016: TK_0 through K_I_3) (existing PtkpStatus enum)
- [x] Progressive tax rates (Pasal 17 UU HPP: 5%/15%/25%/30%/35%) (existing)
- [ ] TER rate lookup tables (Category A/B/C per PMK 168/2023) — not yet, uses annualization method

### 16.5 Cleanup
- [x] Update API Reference tables with all 16 controllers
- [x] Update FAQ and Troubleshooting
- [x] Remove "Contoh Interaksi dengan AI" (inline examples per section instead)
- [x] Remove "Pengembangan Selanjutnya" (roadmap doesn't belong in operational manual)
- [x] Remove "Lihat Juga" (cross-references inline)
- [x] Update UserManualGenerator Section entries — H1 title updated

- FP 03 template currently has 3 lines (no separate PPN line) — bug prevented for future template updates

### BUG-002: Direct PUT Creates Broken DRAFTs ✅
- [x] `updateTransaction()` now always calls `replaceAccountMappings()` when template changes, clearing stale old mappings
- Previously only called when `accountSlots` was non-empty, leaving orphan mappings from old template

### BUG-003: PUT lineAccountOverrides Not Idempotent ✅
- [x] Added missing `transactionRepository.save(transaction)` at end of `replaceAccountMappings()`
- JPA auto-flush within `@Transactional` masked the bug, but explicit save ensures correctness

### BUG-004: Analysis Endpoint Returns Empty journalEntries for DRAFT ✅
- [x] `getTransactionDetail()` now generates preview journal entries for DRAFT transactions using `TransactionApiService.previewJournalEntries()`
- Falls back to empty list if preview generation fails

## Phase 17: SPT Tahunan Badan Data Export ✅

**Goal:** Generate Coretax-ready data for SPT Tahunan PPh Badan lampiran. The app already has the underlying data (financial statements, fiscal adjustments, PPh calculations, depreciation, payroll); this phase adds structured exports matching Coretax L1–L9 formats so users can key-in or XML-import into Coretax with minimal manual effort.

**Context:** PER-11/PJ/2025 defines 24 lampiran for SPT Tahunan Badan in Coretax. Most are key-in or prepopulated by DJP. Only L9 (Penyusutan) and L10A/L11A have DJP XML import templates. The app targets SMEs — L10 (transfer pricing), L11B/C (foreign debt), L12–L14 (BUT/facilities) are out of scope.

## Phase 18: PPh 21 TER Method (PMK 168/2023) ✅

**Goal:** Replace annualization method with TER (Tarif Efektif Rata-rata) method per PMK 168/2023 for monthly PPh 21 withholding. December uses annual reconciliation with progressive brackets (PP 58/2023).

**Bug ref:** BUG-009 — annualization produced 240,126/month for K_2 gross 11,253,000. TER method correctly produces 281,325 (2.5%).

### 18.1 TER Rate Tables ✅
- [x] `TerCategory` enum with PTKP → TER Category mapping (A: TK_0, TK_1, K_0; B: TK_2, TK_3, K_1, K_2; C: K_3, K/I_*)
- [x] TER rate lookup tables with income brackets per category (PMK 168/2023 Lampiran A/B/C)
- [x] Stored as Java enum constants (no DB table — rates change infrequently)

### 18.2 Monthly TER Calculation (Jan–Nov) ✅
- [x] `Pph21CalculationService.calculateTer()` — TER rate lookup by gross salary bracket
- [x] Monthly PPh 21 = gross salary × TER rate (no BPJS/biaya jabatan deduction before lookup)
- [x] TER category determined by employee's PTKP status
- [x] `PayrollService` uses TER for months 1–11

### 18.3 December Annual Reconciliation ✅
- [x] `Pph21CalculationService.calculateDecemberReconciliation()` — progressive brackets per PP 58/2023
- [x] December PPh 21 = annual tax minus sum of Jan–Nov TER withholdings
- [x] Annual calculation: gross → biaya jabatan (5%, max 6M) → neto → subtract PTKP → PKP → progressive rates
- [x] `PayrollDetailRepository.findPriorMonthsInYear()` query for prior month lookups

### 18.4 Web Calculator + Testing ✅
- [x] Web PPh 21 calculator updated to TER method (was annualization)
- [x] 17 unit tests: category mapping, rate lookup, TER monthly calculation, December reconciliation
- [x] 5 functional tests: calculator form, TER calculation, category/rate verification, low salary, form preservation
- [x] Verified against Coretax reference data (K_2, 11.253M → TER 2.5%, PPh21 281,325)

---

## Phase 19: Scheduled Payroll ✅

**Goal:** Automate monthly payroll run creation so users don't need to manually call create/calculate/approve every month.

**Feature request ref:** `finance/feature-request-scheduled-payroll.md`

### 19.1 Schedule Configuration ✅
- [x] `payroll_schedule` table (single-row config: dayOfMonth, baseSalary, jkkRiskClass, autoCalculate, autoApprove, active)
- [x] `PayrollSchedule` entity extending `TimestampedEntity`
- [x] `PayrollScheduleRepository` with findActive/findCurrent helpers

### 19.2 Schedule CRUD API ✅
- [x] `GET /api/payroll/schedule` — get current config (404 if not set)
- [x] `POST /api/payroll/schedule` — create/update (replaces existing)
- [x] `DELETE /api/payroll/schedule` — remove schedule
- [x] OpenAPI annotations on all endpoints

### 19.3 Scheduler ✅
- [x] `PayrollScheduler` — daily cron check (default 6:30 AM)
- [x] On configured dayOfMonth: create DRAFT, optionally calculate, optionally approve
- [x] Startup catch-up via `@EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class)` — checks previous and current month
- [x] Skip if payroll run already exists for the period
- [x] Never auto-post (posting = payment happened, always manual)

---

## Phase 20: Free-Form Journal Entry API ✅

**Goal:** Allow creating journal entries with arbitrary debit/credit lines without requiring a template. Needed for year-end closing journals, correction/adjusting entries, and opening balance entries.

**Feature request ref:** `~/workspace/artivisi/artivisi-hq/finance/feature-request-journal-entry.md`

### 20.1 Journal Entry DTO ✅
- [x] `JournalEntryRequest` record with `JournalLineRequest` nested record
- [x] Bean validation: @NotNull date, @NotBlank description, @Size(min=2) lines, @DecimalMin debit/credit
- [x] OpenAPI `@Schema` annotations for Swagger UI documentation

### 20.2 Service Method ✅
- [x] `TransactionApiService.createJournalEntry()` — validates lines (exactly one of debit/credit > 0), balance (debits == credits), accounts (exist, not header, active)
- [x] Looks up "Jurnal Manual" template automatically (no templateId from caller)
- [x] Pre-creates JournalEntry records at draft time (journal numbers deferred to posting)
- [x] Reuses existing `TransactionService.postWithContext()` pre-created entries path

### 20.3 API Endpoint ✅
- [x] `POST /api/transactions/journal-entry` — creates DRAFT with pre-created journal entries
- [x] `@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_transactions:post')")` — reuses existing scope
- [x] Returns 201 CREATED with TransactionResponse (status=DRAFT)
- [x] OpenAPI `@Operation` and `@ApiResponse` annotations

### 20.4 Preview Support ✅
- [x] Updated `previewJournalEntries()` — returns pre-created entries directly instead of running TemplateExecutionEngine

### 20.5 Data Import Fix ✅
- [x] `DataImportService.importChartOfAccounts()` now sets `isHeader=true` for accounts referenced as parent by other accounts

### 20.6 Functional Tests ✅
- [x] 11 tests in `JournalEntryApiTest`: create (happy path, multi-line, category), post lifecycle, preview, validation errors (unbalanced, both debit+credit, neither, <2 lines, header account, non-existent account)

## Bug Fix: BUG-014 — Tax Export Reads Post-Closing P&L (Zeroed Out)

**Severity:** CRITICAL — all SPT Tahunan exports produce wrong numbers after closing journal is posted
**Bug report ref:** `~/workspace/artivisi/artivisi-hq/finance/bugs-akunting-app.md`

**Root cause:** After posting year-end closing journal (via Phase 20 journal entry API with `category: "CLOSING"`), all tax export endpoints that depend on P&L return zero revenue/expense. The closing journal debits all revenue accounts and credits all expense accounts, zeroing them out. Tax endpoints then compute fiscal adjustments on top of 0.

**Fix:** Exclude closing entries from P&L queries used by tax export services. Closing entries are identified by `transaction.notes = 'CLOSING'` (Phase 20 journal entry API stores category in notes) or `transaction.referenceNumber LIKE 'CLOSING-%'` (FiscalYearClosingService pattern).

### BUG-014.1 Schema & Entity
- [x] Add `closing_entry BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `transactions` table (V002)
- [x] Add `closingEntry` field to Transaction entity
- [x] Set `closingEntry = true` in `FiscalYearClosingService.createClosingTransaction()`
- [x] Set `closingEntry = true` in `TransactionApiService.createJournalEntry()` when category is "CLOSING"

### BUG-014.2 Repository Methods
- [x] Add `sumDebitByAccountAndDateRangeExcludingClosing()` to JournalEntryRepository
- [x] Add `sumCreditByAccountAndDateRangeExcludingClosing()` to JournalEntryRepository
- [x] Filter: `AND t.closingEntry = false`

### BUG-014.3 ReportService
- [x] Add `generateIncomeStatementExcludingClosing(startDate, endDate)` method
- [x] Uses new repository methods to exclude closing entries from P&L

### BUG-014.4 Tax Export Services
- [x] `TaxReportDetailService.generateRekonsiliasiFiskal()` → use `generateIncomeStatementExcludingClosing()`
- [x] `SptTahunanExportService.generateTranskrip8A()` → use `generateIncomeStatementExcludingClosing()`
- [x] `SptTahunanExportService.generateL1()` → inherits fix via `generateRekonsiliasiFiskal()`
- [x] `SptChecklistController.generateChecklist()` → use `generateIncomeStatementExcludingClosing()`

### BUG-014.5 Production Data Fix ✅
- [x] Run `UPDATE transactions SET closing_entry = true WHERE notes = 'CLOSING' OR reference_number LIKE 'CLOSING-%'` on production (artivisi: 2026-03-18, 1 row updated)

### BUG-014.6 Functional Test ✅
- [x] `TaxExportApiTest.testClosingJournalExcludedFromTaxExport` — creates closing journal, posts it, verifies tax export P&L unchanged

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security (users, audit_logs, admin seed)
- V002: Core schema (COA, templates, transactions, clients, projects, invoices, vendors, bills, employees, payroll, assets, inventory, documents, tax)
- V003: Feature schema (device auth, bank recon, analysis reports, tags, alerts, payments, recurring transactions)
- V004: Seed data (transaction sequences, bank parser configs, alert rules)
- V900-V912: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
