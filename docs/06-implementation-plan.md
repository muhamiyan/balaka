### 8.2 Transaction Matching
- [ ] Bank reconciliation entity (period, status, bank account)
- [ ] Auto-matching rules:
  - [ ] Exact match (date + amount)
  - [ ] Fuzzy match (±1 day, same amount)
  - [ ] Description keyword matching
- [ ] Manual matching UI (drag-and-drop or checkbox)
- [ ] Create missing transactions from unmatched statement items
- [ ] Mark as "bank only" or "book only" for discrepancies

### 8.3 Reconciliation Reports
- [ ] Reconciliation summary (matched, unmatched, discrepancies)
- [ ] Bank reconciliation statement (book balance → bank balance)
- [ ] Outstanding items list
- [ ] PDF/Excel export

**Value analysis (manual reconciliation time per month):**
- 20-30 transactions: 5-10 min (easy, no automation needed)
- 50-100 transactions: 15-30 min (manageable)
- 200-300 transactions: 1-2 hours (tedious, automation helpful)
- 500+ transactions: 3+ hours (automation essential)

**Phase 8 Deliverable:** Bank statement import, auto-matching, manual matching UI, and reconciliation reports.

## Phase 9: Analytics & Insights

**Goal:** Provide trend analysis, smart alerts, and flexible transaction tagging

### 9.1 Trend Analysis
- [ ] Revenue trend chart (12 months)
- [ ] Expense trend by category (12 months)
- [ ] Profit margin trend (12 months)
- [ ] Cash flow trend (12 months)
- [ ] Comparison: current period vs previous period
- [ ] Comparison: current period vs same period last year
- [ ] Chart library integration (Chart.js or similar)

### 9.2 Smart Alerts
- [ ] Alert entity (type, threshold, enabled, last_triggered)
- [ ] Alert types:
  - [ ] Cash low warning
  - [ ] Overdue receivables
  - [ ] Expense spike (vs average)
  - [ ] Project cost overrun
  - [ ] Project margin drop
  - [ ] Payment collection slowdown
  - [ ] Client concentration risk
- [ ] Alert threshold settings per type
- [ ] Enable/disable individual alerts
- [ ] Dashboard notification display
- [ ] Email notification (optional)
- [ ] Alert history and acknowledgment

### 9.3 Transaction Tags
- [ ] Tag type entity (user-defined: "Channel", "Campaign", "Category")
- [ ] Tag entity (values per type)
- [ ] Tag type CRUD UI
- [ ] Tag CRUD UI
- [ ] Multi-tag per transaction (journal entry)
- [ ] Tag filters in transaction list
- [ ] Tag-based reports (summary by tag)

**Phase 9 Deliverable:** Trend charts, configurable alerts, and flexible transaction tagging.

## Phase 10+: Future Enhancements

### Budget Management
- [ ] Budget entity (account, period, amount)
- [ ] Budget per account per period
- [ ] Budget CRUD UI
- [ ] Copy from previous period
- [ ] Budget vs Actual report
- [ ] Variance analysis
- [ ] Over-budget highlighting
- [ ] PDF/Excel export

### Additional Industry Templates
- [ ] Photography COA and journal templates
- [ ] General Freelancer COA and journal templates
- [ ] Industry-specific salary component templates

### Account Balances (Materialized) - Performance Optimization

**Not implemented.** The system uses real-time calculation by querying journal_entries directly.

**Why not materialized?**
- Current approach: Sum debit/credit from journal_entries for each report
- PostgreSQL performance with indexes is excellent for typical transaction volumes
- Materialization adds complexity: triggers, recalculation logic, cascade updates
- Trade-off: Simple architecture vs. marginal performance gain

**Performance analysis (PostgreSQL with proper indexes):**
- 10,000 journal lines: <50ms (5 years @ 80 tx/month)
- 50,000 journal lines: ~100ms (5 years @ 400 tx/month)
- 100,000 journal lines: ~200ms (5 years @ 800 tx/month)
- 500,000 journal lines: ~500ms (5 years @ 4,000 tx/month)

**For typical small IT services (100 tx/month):** Would take 40+ years to reach 100,000 lines.

**When to reconsider:** Only if report generation consistently exceeds 2 seconds and users report slowness (>500 transactions/month sustained for several years).

**Implementation approach if needed:**
- [ ] Create account_balances table with monthly snapshots
- [ ] Trigger balance update on journal entry post/void
- [ ] Background job for period-based aggregation
- [ ] Balance recalculation utility for data fixes
- [ ] Modify ReportService to query materialized balances instead of journal_entries

### Document Management Enhancements
- [ ] S3-compatible storage backend
- [ ] Image compression on upload
- [ ] PDF optimization
- [ ] ClamAV virus scanning
- [ ] Bulk upload
- [ ] Document access logging

### Advanced Features (As Needed)
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] API for mobile app
- [ ] Custom report builder
- [ ] Dashboard analytics
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Admin: view soft-deleted records

### Custom Projects (Per Client Request)
- [ ] PJAP integration (e-Faktur, e-Bupot)
- [ ] Digital signature (PSrE)
- [ ] E-Meterai integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Database Migration Strategy

### Rules
1. **Always add, never remove** - Mark columns as deprecated, don't delete
2. **Nullable first** - New columns must be nullable or have defaults
3. **Backfill separately** - Data migration in separate step from schema change
4. **Test rollback** - Every migration must have tested rollback script

### Migration Files
- V001: Security schema (users)
- V002: Security data (admin user)
- V003: App schema (COA, journal entries, templates, transactions, etc.)
- V004: App seed data
- V901-V907: Test data migrations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Functional tests (Playwright) for critical paths
- Migration tests on sample data

### Critical Paths to Test
1. Transaction creation and posting
2. Journal entry balance validation
3. Report generation
4. User authentication
5. Period locking enforcement
