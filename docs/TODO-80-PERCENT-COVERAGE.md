## Testing Strategy

### Functional Test Approach (Primary)
- Use Playwright for UI-driven functional tests
- One functional test covers: Template → Controller → Service → Entity → Repository
- High ROI: ~5-10 lines test code covers ~50-100 lines production code
- Tests real user workflows and scenarios

### Integration Test Approach (Secondary)
- Use Spring Boot Test with TestContainers for database
- Test service layer integration with real database
- Test complex business logic and transaction management
- Test concurrent operations and data consistency

### Unit Test Approach (Minimal)
- Only for pure utility functions
- Only for complex calculation logic in isolation
- Avoid unit testing simple CRUD operations
- Avoid mocking when integration testing is feasible

---

## Execution Plan

### Week 1-2: High-Impact Tests

- Enhance ProjectTest with milestone and payment term scenarios

### Week 7-8: Configuration & Settings Tests
- Create CompanyConfigTest with company setup scenarios
- Create SettingsTest with system configuration scenarios
- Enhance UserManagementTest with security scenarios

### Week 9-10: Edge Cases & Refinement
- Add error handling tests to all test files
- Add validation tests for all forms
- Add edge case tests (empty data, large data, special characters)
- Review and improve test coverage reports

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric**: Instruction coverage ≥ 80%
- **Secondary Metric**: Branch coverage ≥ 70%
- **Quality Metric**: All tests pass consistently
- **Maintainability Metric**: Test execution time < 5 minutes for functional tests
- **ROI Metric**: Lines of test code : Lines of production code covered ratio ≥ 1:10

---

## Notes

1. **Focus on Value**: Prioritize tests that verify business-critical features
2. **Real Scenarios**: Test actual user workflows, not artificial unit test scenarios
3. **Data Setup**: Use realistic test data, not minimal mock data
4. **Error Cases**: Don't forget negative scenarios and validation
5. **Maintenance**: Keep tests maintainable - use page objects, helper methods, test data builders
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure tests run automatically in CI pipeline
7. **Documentation**: Document complex test scenarios and expected behaviors
