## Getting Started

### Setting Up Initial Account Balances

For existing businesses moving to this accounting system, you'll need to set up opening balances for your Chart of Accounts. The system uses **dynamic balance calculation** from journal entries, so initial balances are created through a single opening balance journal entry.

#### How to Create Opening Balances

**Create ONE journal entry with multiple journal items (one per account):**

1. **Journal Entry Header:**
   - **Date:** Your fiscal year start (e.g., 2025-01-01)
   - **Description:** "Saldo Awal per 1 Januari 2025"
   - **Reference:** "SALDO_AWAL_2025"

2. **Journal Items (one per account with balance):**

| Account Code | Account Name | Debit | Credit |
|--------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 1.1.01 | Kas | 50,000,000 | |
| 1.1.02 | Bank BCA | 75,000,000 | |
| 1.3.01 | Piutang Usaha | 30,000,000 | |
| 2.1.01 | Hutang Usaha | | 20,000,000 |
| 2.1.02 | PPN Masukan | | 5,000,000 |
| 3.1.01 | Modal Disetor | | 120,000,000 |
| 3.1.02 | Laba Ditahan | | 10,000,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **155,000,000** | **155,000,000** |

3. **Key Requirements:**
   - **Balanced Entry:** Total Debit must equal Total Credit
   - **Normal Balance Rules:**
     - Asset accounts (1.x.x) → Debit balances
     - Liability accounts (2.x.x) → Credit balances
     - Equity accounts (3.x.x) → Credit balances
     - Revenue accounts (4.x.x) → Credit balances (usually zero for opening)
     - Expense accounts (5.x.x) → Debit balances (usually zero for opening)
   - **Skip Zero-Balance Accounts:** Only include accounts with actual balances

The system's balance calculation will automatically use these opening balances as the starting point for all subsequent transactions and reports.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 25**
  - Linux/macOS: [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) - `sdk install java 25-open`
  - Windows: [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Docker** - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`) is included in the project.

## Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run specific test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountServiceTest
```

### Functional Tests (Playwright)

Functional tests use Playwright for browser automation. They require Docker for Testcontainers (PostgreSQL).

```bash
# Run all functional tests (headless)
./mvnw test -Dtest=**/functional/*Test

# Run specific functional test
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest
```

**Playwright Configuration Options:**

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `playwright.headless` | `true` | Run browser in headless mode |
| `playwright.slowmo` | `0` | Delay between actions in milliseconds |

```bash
# Run with visible browser
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest -Dplaywright.headless=false

# Run with visible browser and slow motion (useful for debugging)
./mvnw test -Dtest=ChartOfAccountSeedDataTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=100
```
